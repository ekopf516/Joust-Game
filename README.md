Joust-Game is a two-player game similar to the 1970s arcade game "Joust"

<b>How to play:</b><br>
Player one: Green bird, uses 'a' to move left and 's' to move right.<br>
Player two: Red bird, uses 'k' to move left and 'l' to move right. 

The objective of the game is for the players to continuously try to land on top of the other player's bird. Each time one lands on top of the other, the player of the bird on top will gain one point and the loser's bird will be reset to the top of the screen. The first player to five points win; once someone wins, the game will end. 

Players have the option to pause and continue the game using the 'p' and 'c' keys respectively.
